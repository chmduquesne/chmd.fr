Lighttpd external-auth demo
===========================

Welcome to the external-auth demo. Let us take a walk through the
possibilities of this magnet script.

Goal of this magnet script
==========================

The goal of this magnet script is to let you restrict access of certain
pages of your lighttpd server through an external mechanism. This external
mechanism can be openid, but also oauth, or any other method.

How it works
============

When a request is made, the script checks for a cookie.
