<h1 id="hpass">Hpass</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Hpass is a different approach to passwords management. It allows you to use different passwords on every websites, without having to remember them. Instead, you memorize one <strong>unique</strong> master password. Using your master password and the domain name of the web site, Hpass generates a unique password for the web site.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>Hpass was inspired by various extensions and bookmarklets (the most famous being <a href="http://supergenpass.com">Supergenpass</a>). The reason why I wrote Hpass is because Supergenpass sucks in many aspects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The algorithm is not proven to be secure (See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3484954/628786">why</a>).</li>
<li>Supergenpass bookmarklet implementation can leak your master password (See <a href="http://akibjorklund.com/2009/supergenpass-is-not-that-secure">how</a>).</li>
<li>I wanted to be able to regenerate any of my passwords using a simple command line.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The way Hpass generates password is dead simple, and can be reproduced easily:</p>
<pre><code>echo -n $DOMAIN | \
    openssl dgst -$HASHTYPE -hmac $MASTER -binary | \
    openssl enc -base64 | \
    cut -c1-$LEN</code></pre>
<p>Where $DOMAIN is the domain name of the website, $HASHTYPE is a type of checksum (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512...), $MASTER is your master password, and $LEN is the length of the desired password.</p>
<h2 id="implementations">Implementations</h2>
<p>Because we need our passwords in different situations, I implemented hpass for several platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's an android version on the google play store. It will open links shared from the browsers, but it can also open a link scanned through a barcode (provided you did not already set a default browser).</li>
<li>On a day to day basis, I use a shell implementation that sits in the tray. It stores/gets the password from gnome-keyring.</li>
<li>I also wrote a javascript implementation, for when both your computer and your cellphone are out of reach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-needs-to-be-improved">What needs to be improved</h2>
<p>I did not add a &quot;salt&quot; in the implementation. Basically, for every domain name, we could append to the master password a random string that would stored and synchronized in a &quot;cloudy&quot; way. This would allow two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Modifying only one password would be easier: right now, it is not possible to modify only <strong>one</strong> of your passwords. When you lose one of your passwords, you need to change your master password to change it, which implies changing every password that you manage with Hpass.</li>
<li>Stealing your master password would not enable an attacker to steal all of your passwords, since this attacker would also need these &quot;salts&quot; to generate your passwords.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, synchronisation is complicated. It is a matter of trust in third parties to store your salts, and of confidence that you will not experiment data loss. This latter aspect is extremely important: should you lose the salts, you would lose all your passwords! I might add support for that some day, but right now, I prefer to keep things simple :)</p>

<li>Hpass is delivered under the GPLv3+.</li>
<li>The icon I have been using for the Hpass android application is from the 'lock' from the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/faenza-icon-theme">faenza gtk icon theme</a>.</li>
