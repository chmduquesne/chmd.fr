<h1 id="hpass">Hpass</h1>
<h2 id="tldr-where-is-the-mobile-version">TL,DR: where is the mobile version?</h2>
<p><a href="http://git.chmd.fr/?p=hpass.git;a=blob_plain;f=js/index.html;hb=HEAD">Here</a></p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Hpass allows you to use different passwords on every websites, without having to remember them. Instead, you memorize one <strong>unique</strong> master password. Using your master password and the domain name of the web site, Hpass generates a unique password for the web site.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>Hpass was inspired by various extensions and bookmarklets (the most famous being <a href="http://supergenpass.com">Supergenpass</a>). However Supergenpass sucks in many aspects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The algorithm is not proven to be secure (See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3484954/628786">why</a>).</li>
<li>Supergenpass bookmarklet implementation can leak your master password (See <a href="http://akibjorklund.com/2009/supergenpass-is-not-that-secure">how</a>).</li>
<li>The algorithm is not easily reproducable (no shell one-liners are available)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The way Hpass generates password can be reproduced in one single command line:</p>
<pre><code>echo -n $DOMAIN | \
    openssl dgst -$HASHTYPE -hmac $MASTER -binary | \
    openssl enc -base64 | \
    cut -c1-$LEN</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$DOMAIN is the domain name of the website;</li>
<li>$HASHTYPE is a type of checksum (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512...);</li>
<li>$MASTER is your master password;</li>
<li>and $LEN is the length of the desired password.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementations">Implementations</h2>
<p>Because we need our passwords in different situations, Hpass is implemented for several platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.chmd.hpass">android version</a>. It will open links shared from the browsers, but it can also open a link scanned through a barcode (provided you did not already set a default browser).</li>
<li>On a day to day basis, the author uses a shell implementation that sits in the tray. It stores/gets the password from gnome-keyring.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://git.chmd.fr/?p=hpass.git;a=blob_plain;f=js/index.html;hb=HEAD">javascript implementation</a> also exists, for when both your computer and your cellphone are out of reach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-needs-to-be-improved">What needs to be improved</h2>
<p>There is no &quot;salt&quot; in the implementation. Basically, for every domain name, a random string could be appended to the master password. This would improve the security, but expose the uses to data loss and require synchronization between the devices used to generate the passwords. The advantages you could get out of it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Modifying only one password would be easier: right now, it is not possible to modify only <strong>one</strong> of your passwords. When you lose one of your passwords, you need to change your master password to change it, which implies changing every password that you manage with Hpass.</li>
<li>Stealing your master password would not enable an attacker to steal all of your passwords, since this attacker would also need these &quot;salts&quot; to generate your passwords.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, synchronisation is complicated. It is a matter of trust in third parties to store your salts, and of confidence that you will not experiment data loss. This latter aspect is extremely important: should you lose the salts, you would lose all your passwords!</p>
